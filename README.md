# AI for Business Leaders
Udacity AI for Business Leaders Project

## Scenario Introduction - Auto Manufacturer: TeknoVe
TeknoVe is an Irish-headquartered manufacturer of electric vehicles with global operations across China, Germany, Canada, and Mexico. The company operates its own sales and assembly facilities but relies heavily on vendors for specific component manufacturing. They also have a global leasing arm, TeknoVe Financial.

In this scenario, your CEO has launched an initiative to use Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence technologies in key, high-leverage business areas. They’ve tasked you with developing ideas for implementing ML and AI and then narrowing the use cases down to a shorter list.

### Project Assets
There are four documents you will use as you complete this project.

Project Steps
High-Level Project Tasks
Review the ten use cases for TeknoVe
Select four of ten use cases you would like to explore further (see Step 1A on Project Sheet).
Narrow down the four use cases to three based on 5V analysis (see Step 2C on Project Slide).
Prioritize the top two use cases after performing resource constraints analysis (see Step 4C on Project Slide).
Run a survey on 3 use cases and seek inputs from at least 5 people (see Step 6A on Google Form).
Create final presentation slides for your final ML/AI strategy (see Step 7).
Step 1 - Looking for Paradigm Shifts
(Files - TeknoVe Business Case / Project Steps)

Download the TeknoVe Business Case doc: Read the initial descriptions of ten use cases there for implementing AI/ML in TeknoVe.
Complete four Step 1A tabs in Project Steps: Your task is to narrow down from ten to four use cases. You can select any of the top four most viable use cases that you want to explore further. You are guided in the directions to create short names and storyboards for four of your use cases.
Complete two Step 1B tabs in Project Steps: Choose two objectives from step 1A. Follow the directions to share your inspiration and vision for what you hope to achieve in each use case.
Step 2 - Mathematical Constraints as a First Filter
(Files - Project Steps / Project Slides)

Complete five Step 2A tabs in Project Steps: Answer the 5V questions regarding the data you expect to need in each use case.
Complete five Step 2B tabs in Project Steps: Make a basic assessment of what types of machine learning and AI operations are being used in each use case.
Complete Step 2C in Project Slides (Slide 2): Follow the directions to create a grid in which you will begin prioritizing and narrowing your use cases from four to three.
Step 3 - Laying Out Architectures with Common Patterns
(Files - Project Steps / Project Slides)

Complete Step 3 in Project Slides doc (Slide 7): Follow directions to lay out architectures for your remaining use cases.
Step 4 - Hard Choices Around Data
(Files - Project Steps / Project Slides)

Complete three Step 4A tabs in Project Steps: Based on the choices you have made in Steps 2 and 3, you will answer a series of questions to “pressure test” your vision for each use case.
Complete Step 4B in Sheet Project doc: Analyze the results of your questions in Step 4A to gain further insight into how to prioritize your use cases in step 4C. (Note there is no writing or deliverable required for this step 4B.)
Complete Step 4C in Project Slides doc (Slide 14): Complete a second prioritization grid, and make some difficult decisions regarding resource constraints to narrow down your use cases further from 3 to 2.
Step 5 - Operational Considerations - Accuracy, Bias, and Ethics
(Files - Project Steps / Project Slides)

Complete Step 5 in Project Slides doc (Slide 19): You’ll reflect on the lifecycle of each of your remaining use cases, and write how you will measure and monitor for accuracy, overfitting/underfitting, and ethical considerations.
Step 6 - Tying it All Together
(Files - Project Steps / Final Presentation)

Complete Step 6 in Project Steps (Slide 24): You'll use slide 26 in Final Presentation (Slide 4)
Complete The Final Presentation Template: Synthesize the results of all of your analyses into a final ML/AI strategy proposal.
